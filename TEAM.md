# Team St Bals Working Structure

## Check Ins - 
* Morning Stand Up
  * Discuss activities for the day, assign Trello cards to pairs

* Afternoon Check In
  * Discuss progress made, talk through code, blockers etc

## Retros -
* Check in with how people have found the day (non-work related)

## Expectations -
- 9am-5pm expected working hours during the day.
- No obligation to work outside of these hours, but feel free to if you want to, but with the expectation that you should talk through what you've done with the team.

## Work Ethic
- Support each other, if one pair is speeding ahead or progressing with a lot of cards, we should take a break / reconvene and see if this pair can assist other pairs instead of writing all of the app themselves.
- Don't merge your own PRs - at least one other person should review it before pushed to main.

## Values -
- Extreme Programming?

## Workflow
- Create a production branch and development branch
